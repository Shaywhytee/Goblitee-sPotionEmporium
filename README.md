Goblitee's Potion Emporium

This is a learning exercise I wrote. It's a simulation of a trip to a potion shop

There are a couple of known bugs:
    The baseOnly() and the ingredientOnly() don't properly calculate the potion cost
    There are a couple of instances where the next button is enabled and pressing it can mess up the progression
    Right now it is possible to select both a base only and ingredient only which means you essentially purchase nothing

The user flow is:
    Talk
    Next
    select Potion Base or choose ingredient only
    Next
    select Ingredient or Base only
